# Python Tutorial

## 1. What is Python?
Python has quickly become a favorite- it’s being taught in universities, and also being used for everything from scripting and web development to machine learning and data science. But what is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and dynamically-typed. Guido Van Rossum, its BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), named it over the British comedy group Monty Python. The implementation we widely use is CPython (written in C). Python has powerful frameworks and libraries. You can install these libraries with pip, and find them in PyPI (Python Package Index).

**There is more than one reason why you should learn this language:**

 - It is great for both startups as well as big organizations. It is also beginner-friendly.
 - Python is open-source and has a large community. It is one of the top 5 in the largest communities on StackOverflow, the most-used languages on GitHub, and the largest Meetup communities.
 - It has great career opportunities. Python jobs pay well and provide stability.
 - Python has many powerful frameworks like Django and Flask for web development. They take care of the trivial tasks and make it easier to develop for the web.
 - It is also great for machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. It has libraries for tasks involved in these domains.
 - You can use Raspberry Pi to create DIYs and other projects like robots, arcade machines, remote-controlled toys, and cameras.
 - Python’s readability and ease-of-use make developers more productive.
