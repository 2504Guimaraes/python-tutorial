# Python Tutorial

## 1. What is Python?
Python has quickly become a favorite- it’s being taught in universities, and also being used for everything from scripting and web development to machine learning and data science. But what is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and dynamically-typed. Guido Van Rossum, its BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), named it over the British comedy group Monty Python. The implementation we widely use is CPython (written in C). Python has powerful frameworks and libraries. You can install these libraries with pip, and find them in PyPI (Python Package Index).

## 2. Why Learn Python?
**There is more than one reason why you should learn this language:**

 - It is great for both startups as well as big organizations. It is also beginner-friendly.
 - Python is open-source and has a large community. It is one of the top 5 in the largest communities on StackOverflow, the most-used languages on GitHub, and the largest Meetup communities.
 - It has great career opportunities. Python jobs pay well and provide stability.
 - Python has many powerful frameworks like Django and Flask for web development. They take care of the trivial tasks and make it easier to develop for the web.
 - It is also great for machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. It has libraries for tasks involved in these domains.
 - You can use Raspberry Pi to create DIYs and other projects like robots, arcade machines, remote-controlled toys, and cameras.
 - Python’s readability and ease-of-use make developers more productive.

## 3. What is it used for?
Python is a general-purpose language, but is used almost everywhere:
 - Web development
- Game development
- Machine Learning
- Data Science (preferred)
- Artificial Intelligence (ex- robotics)
- Scripting
- Computer Vision
- Scraping
- Natural Language Processing
- Data analytics
- Scientific and Numeric computing
- Software Application Development
- Desktop GUI
- Network Programming

## 4. Is Python Easy to Learn?
Python is definitely easy to learn, that is why it is taught to university students- to create interest in programming. Python is:

 - Easy to learn- it has a smooth learning curve
 - Easy to read- it is easy to read and understand someone else’s code
 - Easy to write- Python’s syntax is like English
 - Easy to debug- it gives you full tracebacks
 
## 5. How to Learn?
Want to learn Python and build a career in it? We have laid down steps to help you:

 - Follow online tutorials
 - Code while you learn
 - Read books
 - Watch videos/ Do an online Python course
 - Work with machine learning and other libraries
 - Build projects
 - Read interview questions
 - Contribute to open-source projects

### Top Python Books
These are some books you should read to improve your Python skills:

Python in a Nutshell - Alex Martelli
Violent Python - TJ O’Connor
Python Pocket Reference - Mark Lutz


## 6. Basics of Python for beginners

### a. Basics Constructs

Let’s first see what Python looks like.

 - Functions - Collections of statements grouped under a name. May or may not return a value.
 - Classes and Objects - Python is object-oriented. A class is an abstract data type and a blueprint with no values. An object is an instance of a class. Everything in Python is an object.
 - Modules - Modules are collections of related classes and functions. You can use code from these instead of writing your own for trivial functionality.
 - Packages - They are collections of related modules. You can also create your own packages.
 - Lists - These are collections of values in the CSV format. Lists are mutable objects.
 - Tuples - These are like lists, but immutable.
 - Dictionaries - These are collections of key-value pairs defined using curly braces.
 - Sets - They can’t have duplicates, and are mutable.
 - Comments and Docstrings - Comments are for the developer, explain code and are declared with a hash (#) sign. Docstrings are documentation strings that explain code. There are no multiline comments.

### b. Python Features

Let’s discuss some features of Python now.

 - Easy to learn/read/write/debug
 - Expressive
 - Free and Open-Source
 - High-level
 - Portable
 - Interpreted
 - Object-oriented
 - Extensible
 - Embeddable
 - Large standard library
 - GUI programming
 - Dynamically typed

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/data-flair/python-tutorial/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/data-flair/python-tutorial/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
